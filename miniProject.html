<!--Introduction -->
<section>
    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>In today's world where technology is everywhere, it's important that everyone, including older people, can benefit from it. Especially now, with the pandemic causing extra difficulties, 
        we need to pay attention to what older folks need to stay healthy and happy. That's why our team started working on making an app just for them. We've been talking to a lot of older people to understand what they need, 
        and we think we can make something that really helps them. We want to create a sort of standard that other apps can follow to make sure they're doing a good job for older users.
    </p>

<!--The Problem -->
<section>
    <h2>The problem:</h2>
    <p>As people get older, they encounter various obstacles, like difficulty moving around and feeling lonely, 
        which have become even more challenging during the pandemic. Many apps meant to help with health and wellness don't really consider what older folks need. 
        They can be hard to use and don't offer features that older adults find helpful. Also, some seniors don't trust these apps, so they don't use them much. 
        This means many older people aren't getting the support they need to stay healthy and connected in today's digital age.
    </p>
</section>
<!--The Solution -->
<section>
    <h2>Solution:</h2>
    <p>We know there's a big gap in how older people use technology to stay healthy and happy. So, our team is working hard to fix that by creating a sort of standard for apps made for older folks. 
        We're doing a lot of research, like talking to older people and testing things out, to understand exactly what they need. We want our app to be easy to use, so anyone can use it without any trouble. 
        It'll have things like reminders for medicine and exercises, and ways to connect with friends and feel good mentally. We're making sure our app is trustworthy and reliable, so older people can feel confident using it. 
        We believe our app will help older folks feel more independent, connected, and healthy, even when they're dealing with tough times like the pandemic.
